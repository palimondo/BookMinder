- The README.md should be created based on a thorough review of ORIGINAL_VISION.md
- Conduct a comprehensive requirements gathering interview with the user to fully understand project scope
- The original vision may contain broader goals than previously implemented - ensure these are captured
- Follow the requirement gathering dialogue process for each new feature
- When creating README.md, ensure it reflects the complete vision rather than a narrower implementation
