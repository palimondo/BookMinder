# Claude 4+ Collaboration Guide: Practical Framework for Effective AI Pair Programming

## Introduction

This guide synthesizes lessons learned from the BookMind-to-BookMinder evolution to provide a practical framework for effective collaboration with Claude 4 and future AI models. While Claude 4 addresses many over-eagerness issues, **structured collaboration remains essential** for optimal outcomes.

## Quick Start Checklist

### Before Starting Any Project
- [ ] Create comprehensive CLAUDE.md with constraints
- [ ] Define session boundaries and cost limits  
- [ ] Set up modern tooling (uv, ruff, pre-commit hooks)
- [ ] Establish clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Prepare anti-pattern list

### During Each Session
- [ ] Start with limited scope (1 acceptance criterion)
- [ ] Monitor costs regularly (`/cost` every 10-15 interactions)
- [ ] Batch tool calls when possible
- [ ] Verify constraint adherence
- [ ] Use `/clear` after major milestones

### After Each Session
- [ ] Commit all working changes
- [ ] Review and refine constraints if needed
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Plan next session scope

## CLAUDE.md Framework Template

### Core Structure
```xml
<core_philosophy>
- Code is a liability, not an asset
- Scientific approach - Think hard and form clear hypotheses
- YAGNI - Don't build features until required
- Design for testability
</core_philosophy>

<anti_patterns>
- Large untested implementations
- Complex solutions to simple problems
- Creating files that don't serve immediate requirements
- Adding "just in case" functionality
- Premature optimization
</anti_patterns>

<implementation_process>
1. Start with clear acceptance criteria
2. Formulate working hypotheses  
3. Value incremental progress
4. Prioritize feedback loops
</implementation_process>

<tdd_discipline>
- Always start with a failing test
- Run & Verify RED: Execute specific test and confirm failure
- Implement GREEN: Write minimum code to pass
- Run All Tests: Confirm no regressions
- Refactor: Improve while keeping tests green
</tdd_discipline>

<session_workflow>
- Start sessions with clear, limited scope
- Define acceptance criteria upfront
- Use `/clear` to reset context after major milestones
- Monitor token usage during development
- Batch related tool calls where possible
</session_workflow>
```

### Customization Guidelines
1. **Project-Specific Anti-Patterns**: Add patterns specific to your domain
2. **Technology Constraints**: Include language/framework-specific guidelines
3. **Team Standards**: Integrate existing code standards
4. **Quality Gates**: Define specific coverage and quality thresholds

## Session Management Framework

### Session Planning
```markdown
## Session Scope Template
**Goal**: [Single, testable outcome]
**Acceptance Criteria**: [Specific, measurable criteria]
**Estimated Effort**: [1-3 commits]
**Success Metrics**: [How you'll know you're done]
**Out of Scope**: [Explicitly excluded items]
```

### Cost Management Strategy
- **Budget Target**: $3-5 per session maximum
- **Monitoring Frequency**: Every 10-15 AI interactions
- **Escalation Triggers**: 
  - Cost >$5 → Reassess scope
  - Cost >$7 → Emergency session end
- **Tool Call Optimization**: Batch related operations

### Context Management
```markdown
Use `/clear` after:
- Completing acceptance tests
- Major architectural decisions
- Switching between distinct features
- Reaching $4-5 in session costs
```

## Constraint Effectiveness Guidelines

### High-Impact Constraints (Implement First)
1. **YAGNI Enforcement**: Explicitly prohibit anticipatory features
2. **Implementation Checklists**: Step-by-step verification gates
3. **Session Boundaries**: Clear scope and cost limits
4. **Anti-Pattern Enumeration**: Specific "don't do" lists

### Medium-Impact Constraints
1. **Code Style Guidelines**: Consistent formatting and naming
2. **Testing Standards**: Coverage thresholds and test structure
3. **Documentation Rules**: When and how to document
4. **Git Workflow**: Commit patterns and messaging

### Constraint Density Target
- **Minimum**: 0.5 constraint lines per 1000 code lines
- **Optimal**: 0.6-0.8 constraint lines per 1000 code lines
- **Maximum**: 1.0+ (may become counterproductive)

## Tool Chain Recommendations

### Essential Modern Tools
```toml
# pyproject.toml example
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "your-project"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = ["your-deps"]

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py312"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "I", "N", "W"]

[tool.mypy]  
python_version = "3.12"
strict = true
```

### Pre-commit Configuration
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix]
      - id: ruff-format
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v1.5.1
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
```

### GitHub Actions CI Template
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v1
      - run: uv sync
      - run: uv run pre-commit run --all-files
      - run: uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=xml
      - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Behavioral Pattern Management

### Recognizing Over-Eagerness
**Warning Signs**:
- 5+ commits in single session
- Multiple modules created simultaneously
- Comprehensive feature implementation from simple requests
- Extensive documentation generation
- Complex architectures for simple needs

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Invoke `/clear` to reset context
2. Review and reinforce constraints
3. Reduce session scope
4. Implement stricter acceptance criteria

### Encouraging Focused Behavior
**Techniques**:
- Start each request with explicit scope limitations
- Reference specific constraint sections
- Use implementation checklists
- Provide concrete examples of desired outcomes

### Managing AI Suggestions
```markdown
When AI suggests additional features:
✅ "Let's focus on the current acceptance criteria first"
✅ "Add that to the backlog for future consideration"  
✅ "That's a good idea, but outside current scope"
❌ "Sure, let's implement that too"
```

## Feedback Optimization Framework

### High-Impact Feedback Patterns
1. **Specific Process Steps**: "Verify test fails before implementing"
2. **Reference Materials**: "Following Freeman & Pryce TDD principles"
3. **Explicit Constraints**: "Don't create files not immediately needed"
4. **Structured Checklists**: Step-by-step verification processes

### Feedback Template
```markdown
## Issue Description
[Specific behavior observed]

## Expected Behavior  
[Desired alternative behavior]

## Implementation
[Specific constraints or process changes]

## Verification
[How to confirm the change is effective]
```

### Low-Effectiveness Feedback to Avoid
- Vague behavioral requests ("be more careful")
- Implicit expectations (assuming AI knows best practices)
- General concerns without specific solutions
- Emotional reactions without actionable guidance

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Test-Driven Development
```markdown
## BDD Structure (Recommended)
def describe_feature_context():
    def it_should_behave_in_specific_way():
        # Arrange
        # Act  
        # Assert
```

### Coverage Targets
- **Minimum**: 80% statement coverage
- **Target**: 85-90% statement coverage
- **Focus**: Cover error paths and edge cases
- **Documentation**: Use `pytest --spec` for living docs

### Quality Gates
```markdown
Pre-commit Gates:
✅ Formatting (ruff format)
✅ Linting (ruff check)
✅ Type checking (mypy)
✅ Test execution (pytest)

CI/CD Gates:
✅ All pre-commit checks
✅ Coverage threshold (85%+)
✅ Security scanning
✅ Documentation generation
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Tool Call Efficiency
```markdown
# Efficient: Batch related operations
[Multiple Read calls for related files]
[Multiple Bash calls for related commands]

# Inefficient: Individual operations
Read file → Analyze → Read another → Analyze → Repeat
```

### Context Management
- **Strategic `/clear` usage**: Reset before context becomes unwieldy
- **Session scoping**: Limit to single feature/acceptance criterion
- **Cost monitoring**: Regular `/cost` checks prevent surprises

### ROI Optimization
```markdown
High-ROI Activities:
✅ Constraint framework development
✅ Tool chain modernization  
✅ Test-first development
✅ Quality automation

Low-ROI Activities:
❌ Feature rushing without tests
❌ Complex implementations without constraints
❌ Manual quality processes
❌ Reactive debugging sessions
```
