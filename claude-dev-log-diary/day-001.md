# BookMinder Development Log - Day 1

## Project Setup

- Created basic project structure:
  ```
  bookminder/
    __init__.py
    cli/
      __init__.py
    apple_books/
      __init__.py
      library.py
    export/
      __init__.py
  specs/
    __init__.py
    conftest.py
    apple_books/
      describe_book_library.py
  ```

- Set up Python 3.13 virtual environment with required dependencies
- Created requirements.txt with minimal version constraints

## Requirements

Initial requirements defined through dialogue:
1. List books from Apple Books, preferably sorted by last read date
2. Extract content to enable conversations with LLMs about:
   - The most recently read chapter
   - New highlights since a previous conversation
3. Support Table of Contents extraction
4. Extract highlights with surrounding context
5. Export to Markdown (primary) and optionally HTML formats

## Style Guidelines

1. **No docstrings in specs files** - The `describe_`/`it_` function names should be self-documenting and will produce readable output with `pytest --spec`. No need for additional docstrings.

## Next Steps

1. Create initial BDD tests for core functionality
2. Explore Apple Books data storage locations
3. Implement book listing functionality based on EPUB files and Apple Books metadata
