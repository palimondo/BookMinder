# Conversation Mode Notes

## Current Behavior
When using `-U -a -x Tool`, the tool attempts to show only user and assistant messages while excluding tools. However:
- `-x Tool` only excludes actual tool events (type='tool')
- Assistant messages that only contain tools still appear as `[Tools: ...]`
- This makes the output less clean for conversation viewing

## Desired Behavior (Old --conversation flag)
Show only:
- User messages (questions, responses)
- Assistant text responses
- Exclude: tool calls, tool results, assistant messages that only invoke tools

## Current Workaround
```bash
# Use grep to filter out tool-only lines
./explore_session.py session -U -a | grep -v "Tools:"

# Or use -x Tool to at least remove the actual tool events
./explore_session.py session -U -a -x Tool
```

## Implementation Ideas
1. Add a special filter for "TextOnly" that excludes assistant messages with only tools
2. Modify the exclude Tool behavior to also exclude tool-only assistant messages
3. Add a dedicated --conversation flag that sets up the right combination

## Technical Details
Assistant messages have these fields:
- `text`: Regular text content
- `thinking`: Thinking content
- `tools`: List of tool names invoked

An assistant message with only tools has:
- Empty or missing `text`
- Empty or missing `thinking`  
- Non-empty `tools` list

These currently display as `[N] ‚è∫ [Tools: ToolName1, ToolName2]`
