# Task Sub-Agent Visibility Findings

## Critical Update (2025-08-02) - Sidechain Events ARE Visible!
**IMPORTANT CORRECTION TO PREVIOUS FINDINGS**

### What We Initially Thought (INCORRECT)
We believed sub-agent actions were not visible in JSONL transcripts based on session e583 analysis.

### What We Actually Discovered (CORRECT)
After creating characterization tests and checking raw JSONL:

1. **Sidechain events ARE in the JSONL transcripts**
   - Raw JSONL contains events with `"isSidechain": true`
   - Session e583 has 130 sidechain events!
   - These include sub-agent messages and tool calls

2. **xs DOES show sidechain events**
   - They appear as regular events in the timeline
   - No special marking or filtering
   - All sub-agent actions are visible

3. **The Real Issue:**
   - In session e583, xs showed limited output because:
     - The Task failed/timed out early
     - Sub-agent didn't complete its work
     - NOT because events were hidden

4. **Key Finding:**
   - This is NOT an architectural limitation
   - Sub-agent visibility works as expected
   - Our previous analysis was based on incomplete data

## Implications for Task Delegation

### Good News:
1. **Full visibility** - We CAN see all sub-agent actions in xs
2. **Debugging is possible** - Failed Tasks can be analyzed
3. **No architectural limitations** - System works as designed

### Updated Best Practices:
1. **Use xs to debug failed Tasks** - All actions are visible
2. **Look for sidechain events** - They show sub-agent's work
3. **Check for timeouts** - Tasks may fail due to time limits

### Characterization Test Added:
Created `specs/sidechain_visibility_spec.py` to document and verify:
- Sidechain events appear in timeline
- Summary counts include sidechain actions
- Search finds content in sidechain events

## User's Critical Intervention
The user correctly identified this as a potential bug in xs rather than an architectural limitation:
> "I just want to make sure you are correctly detecting architectural limitation and not a bug in `xs`"

This prompted us to:
1. Check the raw JSONL file directly
2. Discover sidechain events DO exist
3. Create characterization tests
4. Correct our understanding

## Testing Methodology
To verify Task visibility:
1. Check raw JSONL for `isSidechain` markers: `grep -c '"isSidechain":true' session.jsonl`
2. Use xs timeline to see all events: `./xs session -t`
3. Create characterization tests for edge cases
4. Don't assume limitations - verify with data
