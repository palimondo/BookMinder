## day-004.md (Updated with Continued Session) Summary

This log covers the initial goal of preparing the BookMinder project for GitHub and modernizing its toolchain.

*   **Initial Goal:** Publish BookMinder to GitHub for multi-machine development and public learning, and switch to `uv` and `ruff`.
*   **Branching Strategy:** A new branch `astral` was created for the tooling modernization (uv, ruff).
*   **Toolchain Modernization (`astral` branch):**
    *   **`uv` Setup:**
        *   `uv` was installed via `curl`.
        *   The `$HOME/.local/bin` path was added to `~/.zshrc` for `uv` accessibility.
        *   The project was successfully set up in a new uv-managed virtual environment (`.uvenv` initially, then standardized to `.venv`).
        *   `uvx migrate-to-uv` was explored but deemed unsuitable for the existing PEP 621 project; manual setup with `uv venv` and `uv pip install` was used.
    *   **`ruff` Setup:**
        *   `pyproject.toml`: Development dependencies updated (`black`, `flake8` -> `ruff`). Tool configurations for `black` and `flake8` were replaced with a `[tool.ruff]` section.
        *   `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Hooks updated from `black`/`flake8` to `ruff`/`ruff-format`.
    *   **`pyproject.toml` Compatibility:**
        *   An issue with the `contributors` field causing failures with `setuptools` under Python 3.13 was resolved by merging `contributors` into the `authors` list.
        *   Python version was locked to `==3.13.*` in `requires-python` and updated in `mypy` and `ruff` target versions.
    *   **Documentation:**
        *   `docs/uv_setup.md` created for `uv` instructions.
        *   `CLAUDE.md` updated with new build commands and code style guidelines reflecting `uv` and `ruff`.
        *   `GITHUB_SETUP.md` created with manual GitHub repo creation instructions (since `gh` CLI was not yet set up for auth).
*   **GitHub Repository:**
    *   The repository was to be created manually by Pavol on GitHub as `palimondo/BookMinder`.
    *   The description was extensively bikeshedded to accurately reflect the project's vision, including its nature as a Claude Code pair-programming exercise, TDD/BDD focus, MCP tool goal, and Apple Books integration for LLM discussions.
    *   The final chosen description: "BookMinder: Your personal book club with AI. Pair-programmed with Claude Code through disciplined TDD/BDD, this MCP connector bridges your Apple Books to large language models, enabling thoughtful conversations about ideas that inspire you."
*   **Troubleshooting & Refinement:**
    *   Considerable back-and-forth occurred to understand the best way to migrate to `uv` and the purpose of `hatchling` (which was correctly decided against).
    *   PATH issues for `uv` were resolved.
    *   The user's concern about `rm -rf` led to a safer, additive approach for testing the `uv` environment.
    *   Restored previous commit on `astral` branch using `git reset --hard` after a detour exploring `uvx migrate-to-uv`.
*   **Outcome by end of original day-004.md:** The `astral` branch was modernized with `uv` and `ruff`, and instructions were prepared for publishing to GitHub. The project was tested and working locally with the new tooling.
