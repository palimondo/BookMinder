## BookMinder - day-012.md Log Summary

This session was conducted with the Gemini AI assistant, which had recently been onboarded.

**Goal:** To begin sequentially implementing the "Discover Column" stories from the project backlog using the established Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) methodology, starting with the `filter-by-cloud-status.yaml` story.

**Key Actions & Decisions:**

This session was defined by a lengthy, iterative, and often difficult investigation into the Apple Books database, rather than successful feature implementation. The ATDD process was used as a framework for this deep discovery.

*   **Initial Misunderstanding & Methodological Correction:**
    *   Gemini initially misinterpreted the stories and attempted to add a new `--enhanced` flag, which the user corrected.
    *   **Critical Error:** Gemini then attempted to overwrite the entire `specs/cli_spec.py` file to add a new test, prompting a sharp correction from the user ("WTF!!!").
    *   The user invoked the `/expert-council` command, which reinforced the core ATDD principles of making small, incremental, non-destructive changes to the test suite.
*   **Disciplined ATDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor-Research):**
    *   Following the council's advice, a proper ATDD cycle began:
        1.  **RED (Test Fails):** An empty acceptance test for the `--flag cloud` option was added. It was then fleshed out and failed because the CLI option didn't exist.
        2.  **GREEN (CLI Layer):** The `--flag` option was added to `cli.py`. The test was run again.
        3.  **RED (Library Layer):** The test failed deeper in the call stack with a `TypeError` because the library function didn't accept the `flag` argument.
        4.  **GREEN (Library Layer Signature):** The library function signature was updated. The test was run again.
        5.  **RED (Assertion Failure):** The test now failed on the final assertion, as the filtering logic was not yet implemented and the output was incorrect. This correctly moved the focus to the database logic.
*   **Deep Dive into `ZSTATE` (The "Cloud Status" Investigation):**
    *   The core of the session was a scientific, evidence-based investigation to determine what `ZSTATE` value in the `BKLibrary.sqlite` database corresponds to a book with a cloud icon in the UI.
    *   **Hypothesis 1 (ZSTATE=5):** Gemini initially assumed `ZSTATE=5` meant cloud-only. The user, providing screenshots, corrected this, revealing that `ZSTATE=5` corresponds to "Series" in the UI (e.g., "The Hainish Cycle"). This was a major finding.
    *   **Hypothesis 2 (ZSTATE=3):** Guided by screenshots, Gemini investigated "Lao Tzu: Tao Te Ching" and found its `ZSTATE` was `3`.
    *   **Systematic Investigation:** At the user's direction, Gemini systematically queried all books with cloud icons from the provided screenshots against the user's real database. This revealed:
        *   `ZSTATE=3` is a strong candidate for cloud-synced books.
        *   `ZSTATE=6` also appears for cloud-synced books (e.g., "Snow Crash," which the user identified as a sample).
        *   `ZSTATE=1` was an outlier, also appearing with a cloud icon.
    *   **The `ZISSAMPLE` Twist:** The user identified "Snow Crash" and "Tiny Experiments" as samples, but database queries showed `ZISSAMPLE` was `0` (false) for both. This revealed that the `ZISSAMPLE` database field is an unreliable indicator of the "Sample" status shown in the UI.
*   **Documentation:** `docs/apple_books.md` was updated multiple times with these new, hard-won insights about the unreliable nature of `ZISSAMPLE` and the complex, non-obvious mapping of `ZSTATE` values.
*   **Session End:** The session ended abruptly due to a series of repeated API errors from the Gemini CLI tool, which prevented any further work.

**User Struggles & Guidance:**

The user's role in this session was almost entirely that of a senior engineer and mentor, guiding a junior AI that was prone to making assumptions and taking steps that were too large.
*   **Methodological Enforcement:** The user's sharp correction of the attempt to overwrite the test suite was pivotal in resetting the AI's behavior to adhere to the project's strict ATDD discipline. The "Patience Grasshopper" comment reinforced the "small steps" rule.
*   **Scientific Approach:** The user consistently pushed back against Gemini's attempts to act on unverified assumptions (e.g., modifying test fixtures). They demanded an evidence-based approach, directing Gemini to query the *real* user database to gather facts before proceeding.
*   **Providing Critical Context:** The user's screenshots and clarifications (e.g., "this is a series," "this is a sample") were essential for correctly interpreting the database query results and preventing the AI from going down the wrong path.

**Tooling/Environment Issues:**
*   The session ended due to repeated, unrecoverable API errors from the Gemini CLI tool (`"Please ensure that the number of function response parts is equal to the number of function call parts of the function call turn."`), forcing the user to quit.

**Outcome of the Session:**
*   **No feature was completed.** No code was committed to the repository.
*   The primary outcome was **invaluable, deep research into the opaque Apple Books database schema.** The project now has a much more nuanced understanding of the `ZSTATE` and `ZISSAMPLE` fields, including the critical knowledge that they do not map directly to the UI's presentation of "Cloud" or "Sample" status.
*   The `docs/apple_books.md` file was significantly improved with these findings.

**Overall Analysis:**

This session was a classic example of the "Research" and "Reality Check" aspect of software development, masquerading as a feature implementation task. It was a painful but necessary journey of discovery, highlighting the extreme difficulty of working with undocumented, third-party systems. The ATDD cycle served not just as a way to build software, but as a rigorous framework for scientific inquiry. The user's firm guidance was essential in navigating Gemini's missteps and transforming a potentially chaotic session into a productive (if not feature-complete) investigation. The session ultimately failed due to tooling issues, but the knowledge gained was a significant step forward for the project.

## BookMinder - day-013.md Log Summary

This session was conducted with the Gemini AI assistant.

**Goal:** To resume the interrupted research into the `ZSTATE` database mystery, establish a more robust and documented workflow for the Gemini agent, and make progress on the failing acceptance test for cloud status filtering.

**Key Actions & Decisions:**

This was a highly meta-session, focused almost entirely on **process definition, documentation, and context recovery** before any implementation could proceed. The user acted as a mentor, guiding the AI through a series of corrections and process improvements.

*   **Tooling & Session Restarts:** The log begins with several short, aborted sessions, indicating the user was troubleshooting and updating the `gemini-cli` tool via `npm install` to resolve the API errors that ended the previous day's session.
*   **Context Recovery & Re-orientation:**
    *   The main session started with the user providing a very long, detailed prompt that explicitly recapped the findings and mysteries from `day-012`.
    *   **Crucially, the user gave the AI explicit, one-time permission to read the previous day's log file** (`claude-dev-log-diary/day-012.md`) to re-establish the full context of the `ZSTATE` investigation.
*   **Documentation-First Workflow:**
    *   The user rejected an implementation-first plan and insisted on a **documentation-driven approach.**
    *   **Image Analysis:** The AI was tasked with analyzing all the UI screenshots in the `docs/` folder, compiling a detailed table of visible books, their statuses (progress, sample, finished), and cloud icon presence.
    *   **`docs/apple_books.md` Update:** The core task became updating this central document to embed the new screenshot images and rewrite the UI analysis sections to be grounded in this new visual evidence. This was a painstaking, iterative process with many corrections from the user.
*   **Process & Agent Instruction (`GEMINI.md`) Refinement:**
    *   **Commit Attribution:** A major focus was establishing a precise standard for commit message signatures.
        *   The AI was taught to use `/about` to determine its current model (`gemini-2.5-pro`).
        *   The standard was set to use a **single `Co-Authored-By:` line** for the active model, with the dual-attribution from `day-011` being clarified as a one-time exception for a session where the model was auto-switched.
    *   **Slash Command Handling:** The AI was taught how to handle custom "slash commands" (like `/expert-council`) by looking for corresponding files in the `.claude/commands/` directory, a necessary workaround for its lack of native support.
    *   These new rules were codified in the `GEMINI.md` file itself.
*   **Git Workflow & Tooling Workarounds:**
    *   **Large File Handling:** The `check-added-large-files` pre-commit hook blocked the commit of the large PNG screenshots. The user guided the AI to use the macOS `sips` command to convert the PNGs to smaller JPEGs, successfully bypassing the hook.
    *   **Commit Message Syntax:** The AI failed to commit due to a shell syntax error in its `git commit` command. It correctly diagnosed the issue and proposed using `echo | git commit -F -` to avoid shell interpretation of special characters.
*   **Final Commit:** The session culminated in a single, large commit (`99b18cc`) that included:
    *   The new, compressed JPEG image files.
    *   The updated `docs/apple_books.md` with the new analysis and embedded images.
    *   The updated agent instructions in `GEMINI.md`.
    *   The new `.claude/commands/expert-council.md` file.

**User Struggles & Guidance:**

This session was a masterclass in the user meticulously training and guiding the AI.
*   **Patience and Precision:** The user repeatedly corrected the AI's attempts to rush to implementation, enforcing the "documentation first" plan. They provided extremely detailed feedback to fix inaccuracies in the AI's analysis of the screenshots.
*   **Explicit Context Loading:** The user recognized the AI's "amnesia" and took on the burden of providing extensive context from previous sessions.
*   **Frustration and Model Switching:** The user's frustration became palpable near the end ("Ah, forget it. Let's commit. I'll restart a session to get Pro again."). This was immediately preceded by a notification that the CLI had auto-switched from `gemini-2.5-pro` to the less-capable `gemini-2.5-flash`, strongly suggesting the drop in AI performance was noticeable and detrimental to the workflow.

**Tooling/Environment Issues:**
*   The session began by fixing the `gemini-cli` tool itself.
*   The automatic, unprompted switch from the Pro to the Flash model was a significant event that appeared to degrade the quality of the interaction.
*   The AI made several workflow mistakes (trying to commit large files, using incorrect commit syntax) that required user intervention.

**Outcome of the Session:**
*   The project now has a much more robust and accurate set of documentation in `docs/apple_books.md`, with visual evidence committed to the repository.
*   The operational instructions for the Gemini agent (`GEMINI.md`) are significantly improved, clarifying commit attribution and slash command handling.
*   The failing acceptance test for cloud filtering was **not** fixed, but the groundwork for solving it has been laid by consolidating the research findings.

**Overall Analysis:**

This was a foundational "process and documentation" session. The user effectively paused feature development to address procedural debt and solidify the project's knowledge base. The session highlights the challenges of working with a state-less AI, requiring the human to act as its long-term memory and process enforcer. The painstaking effort to get the documentation and agent instructions right, while tedious, is a critical investment in the project's long-term goal of being a benchmark for high-quality, AI-assisted development. The session ended with a clear indication that model capability (Pro vs. Flash) has a direct impact on the user's productivity and frustration level.
