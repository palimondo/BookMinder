## BookMinder - day-014.md Log Summary

This session was conducted with the Gemini AI assistant.

**Goal:** To meticulously and systematically investigate the `ZSTATE` database values by comparing UI screenshots with live database queries, in order to form a solid, evidence-based hypothesis for what indicates a "cloud" book.

**Key Actions & Decisions:**

This session was a pure research and analysis effort, deliberately avoiding any code implementation to focus on reverse-engineering the Apple Books database.

*   **Context Recovery and Correction:** The session began with the user guiding the AI to the correct context.
    *   The user rejected the AI's initial attempt to jump into implementation, reminding it of the unfinished `ZSTATE` research.
    *   The user gave the AI explicit permission to read specific lines from the previous day's logs (`day-012.md` and `day-013.md`) to fully re-establish context. This was a critical step in getting the AI back on track.
*   **Systematic Database Investigation:**
    *   The core of the session was a methodical process of querying the user's real `BKLibrary.sqlite` database for every book listed in the UI analysis section of `docs/apple_books.md`.
    *   **Efficiency Improvement:** The user corrected the AI's initial inefficient, one-by-one query approach, guiding it to construct a single, comprehensive SQL query using `WHERE ZTITLE IN (...)` to fetch all the necessary data in one go.
*   **Key Data Discoveries:**
    *   **Confirmation of `ZISSAMPLE=1`:** The query for "What's Our Problem?" returned `ZISSAMPLE = 1`. This was a **major correction** to a previous incorrect finding from `day-012`, suggesting that `ZISSAMPLE=1` *can* be a reliable indicator for samples, even if it's not always used (e.g., for "Snow Crash").
    *   **Confirmation of `ZSTATE=3` and `ZSTATE=6`:** Many books with cloud icons in the UI were confirmed to have `ZSTATE=3` or `ZSTATE=6`.
    *   **Confirmation of `ZSTATE=1` Outlier:** Many books *without* cloud icons in the UI were confirmed to have `ZSTATE=1` (e.g., "Working Effectively with Legacy Code," "Refactoring"). This strengthens the hypothesis that `ZSTATE=1` likely means "local" or "downloaded."
    *   **Duplicate Book Entries:** The query for "Attack Surface" returned **two distinct entries** for the same book, one with `ZSTATE=3` and another with `ZSTATE=5`. This was a significant new discovery, suggesting a single book can have multiple records in the database, possibly representing different states (e.g., the book itself and its inclusion in a series).
*   **Documentation Updates (User-led):**
    *   The user manually corrected inaccuracies in `docs/apple_books.md` regarding the cloud status of several books, ensuring the documentation precisely matched the UI screenshots before the AI's data-gathering phase. This highlights the user's active role in maintaining the "ground truth."
*   **Session End (Tooling Failure):** The session ended abruptly due to a tooling failure. After successfully running the large, batched database query, the AI (which had auto-switched to the less-capable `gemini-2.5-flash` model) began printing an endless stream of new lines, forcing the user to manually kill the terminal session.

**User Struggles & Guidance:**

The user continued to act as a senior engineer, mentor, and process owner.
*   **Insistence on Precision:** The user repeatedly intervened to correct the AI's inaccuracies, whether in its documentation updates or its investigative process. The instruction to "meticulously verify" was a recurring theme.
*   **Process Optimization:** The user guided the AI from an inefficient, single-query-per-book method to a much more efficient, batched query, saving time and context.
*   **Providing "Ground Truth":** The user provided critical manual corrections to the documentation and context from their own knowledge of the UI, which the AI could not have known on its own.

**Tooling/Environment Issues:**
*   **Model Downgrade:** The `gemini-cli` tool once again automatically switched from the `pro` model to the `flash` model due to "slow response times."
*   **Critical Failure:** The session was terminated by a critical failure where the `flash` model entered an unresponsive loop after a successful database query. This failure prevented the AI from analyzing the data it had just gathered.

**Outcome of the Session:**
*   **No Code or Documentation Committed:** The session ended before any of the new findings could be analyzed or committed.
*   **Data Gathered:** The primary outcome was a successful, comprehensive database query that gathered the `ZSTATE` and `ZISSAMPLE` values for nearly every book identified in the UI screenshots. This raw data is now available in the log for future analysis.
*   **New Insights:** Crucial new insights were gained, including the `ZISSAMPLE=1` confirmation and the discovery of duplicate book entries with different `ZSTATE` values.

**Overall Analysis:**

This was a session of pure, disciplined research that yielded a trove of valuable data. It successfully moved the project from speculative hypotheses to evidence-based data gathering. However, the session was once again cut short by the instability or limitations of the AI tooling, particularly after the unprompted downgrade to the `flash` model. The project is now sitting on a goldmine of raw data, perfectly poised to formulate a robust, evidence-backed theory of `ZSTATE` mapping in the next session, provided the tooling remains stable.

## BookMinder - day-015.md Log Summary

This session was conducted with the Gemini AI assistant.

**Goal:** To recover from previous tooling failures and session interruptions, abandon flawed assumptions about the test fixture, and conduct a rigorous, database-first investigation into the `ZSTATE` column and other data model mysteries directly from the user's real Apple Books database.

**Key Actions & Decisions:**

This was a session of pure research, marked by a significant methodological shift from using a flawed test fixture to querying the real database as the source of truth.

*   **Context Recovery & Methodological Reset:**
    *   The session began with the user giving explicit permission to read the previous day's log (`day-014.md`) to re-establish context.
    *   The user rejected the AI's initial attempt to fix the tests based on the flawed fixture data.
    *   **Crucial Insight:** The user correctly identified that the minimal test fixture was an unreliable source of truth and directed the AI to investigate the *real* database to understand the data model before touching any implementation or tests.
*   **Systematic Database-First Research:**
    *   **Distinct `ZSTATE` Values:** The AI queried the real database for all unique `ZSTATE` values, discovering `1`, `3`, `5`, and `6`. This immediately proved the test fixture's `NULL` value was incorrect.
    *   **Series Hypothesis (`ZSTATE=5`):** The user's hypothesis that `ZSTATE=5` represents a "Series" entity was **conclusively proven.**
        *   The AI identified the `ZSERIESID` column as the likely link.
        *   It queried for "The Left Hand of Darkness," found its `ZSERIESID`.
        *   It then queried for all records with that same `ZSERIESID`, which returned the owned book (`ZSTATE=1`) and the series itself (`ZSTATE=5`, with the title "Hainish"), confirming the relationship.
    *   **"Want to Read" Investigation:** The AI began a new investigation into the "Want to Read" UI section.
        *   **Composition:** It correctly hypothesized that this list includes unread books (`ZREADINGPROGRESS=0.0`) and samples.
        *   **Ordering:** It disproved the initial hypothesis that the list was ordered by `ZCREATIONDATE` alone and began investigating other date fields.
*   **Developing a Robust Fixture Creation Process:**
    *   **The `copy_book_to_fixture.sh` Script:** The most significant artifact of the session was the collaborative development of a reusable shell script to copy complete book entries from the real database to the test fixture.
    *   **Iterative Debugging:** The development of this script was a painful but illustrative process:
        *   Initial attempts with a simple `sqlite3` one-liner failed due to schema mismatches and `Z_PK` conflicts.
        *   The AI correctly identified `ATTACH DATABASE` as a more robust solution.
        *   The user guided the AI to make the script portable and dynamic by extracting column names and using variables (`$HOME`) instead of hardcoded paths.
        *   The script was debugged through several failures caused by incorrect path construction and file-not-found errors.
    *   **Documentation:** The user insisted that the working script be documented in `docs/apple_books.md` before use, solidifying the process improvement.
*   **Session End (Tooling Issues & User Frustration):** The session was again plagued by tooling issues.
    *   The model was automatically switched from `pro` to `flash`, which the user explicitly noted as a "brain update" or "intelligence downgrade."
    *   The session ended with the user expressing frustration ("STOP FUCKING UP THE RELATIVE PATHS") and quitting after the AI repeatedly failed to debug the fixture script correctly, likely due to the model downgrade.

**User Struggles & Guidance:**

This session was defined by the user's role as an expert debugger and process engineer, patiently guiding the AI through a complex research and development task.
*   **Methodological Purity:** The user enforced a strict "research first, document second, implement last" workflow, correcting the AI every time it tried to jump ahead.
*   **Problem-Solving Direction:** The user provided the key insights that solved major roadblocks, such as identifying the schema mismatch, suggesting the creation of a fixture-copying script, and pointing out the tilde-expansion issue in the shell script.
*   **Recognizing AI Limitations:** The user became acutely aware of the performance drop after the model switched to `flash` and correctly identified that the AI was struggling with tasks it might have handled better on the `pro` model.

**Tooling/Environment Issues:**
*   The automatic model switch from `gemini-2.5-pro` to `gemini-2.5-flash` was a recurring problem that directly correlated with a drop in the AI's performance and an increase in user frustration.
*   The AI struggled significantly with debugging a shell script, making repeated, basic errors in path construction.

**Outcome of the Session:**
*   **No Code Committed:** The session ended before the fixture script or documentation updates could be committed. The working tree was left with many modified and untracked files.
*   **Major Research Breakthroughs:** The session was a resounding success from a research perspective. The meanings of `ZSTATE` values were largely confirmed, the "Series" entity was demystified, and a robust process for creating test fixtures was designed.
*   **A Working (but Undocumented) Tool:** A powerful `copy_book_to_fixture.sh` script was created, which will be invaluable for future test development once it is committed.

**Overall Analysis:**

This was an incredibly productive research session that laid the groundwork for solving the project's core data mapping problems. The user's guidance was essential in navigating the complexities and correcting the AI's repeated errors. The session serves as a stark example of how AI tooling (specifically, forced model downgrades) can directly impact productivity and user trust. The project is now on the cusp of having a fully understood data model and a reliable way to build test fixtures, which will unblock all future development.
