## BookMinder - day-008.md Log Summary

This session was focused on improving the developer experience and fixing issues related to Claude Code's slash commands and Git workflow.

*   **Goal:**
    1.  Diagnose and fix why a custom slash command (`/hi`) was not executing bash commands as intended.
    2.  Improve instructions in `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` to prevent accidental committing of large dev-log files.
*   **Slash Command (`/hi`) Debugging:**
    *   **Initial Problem:** The user noted that the `/hi` command (intended to run `tree`, `pytest --spec`, `git log`, `git status`, and read key docs) was not actually executing the bash commands. Claude had to run them manually in previous sessions.
    *   **Investigation:**
        *   Claude read the `/hi` command definition from `.claude/commands/hi.md`.
        *   Claude fetched and reviewed the Claude Code documentation for slash commands.
    *   **Root Cause Identified:** The bash commands in `hi.md` were missing the required backticks for execution (e.g., `!tree .` instead of `!tree .`). Additionally, an `allowed-tools` metadata field might be needed.
    *   **Refinement (User-Guided):**
        *   The user wanted the `tree` command in `/hi` to explicitly show the `claude-dev-log-diary` directory (so Claude is aware of its existence) but exclude its contents to save tokens.
        *   The user suggested showing the command *before* its output in the `/hi` template for clarity.
        *   The final `tree` command decided upon: `tree -h -I '__pycache__|claude-dev-log-diary' .` (show human-readable sizes, exclude pycache and dev-log contents).
        *   The `allowed-tools` metadata field was updated with specific command patterns: `Bash(tree:*)`, `Bash(pytest:*)`, `Bash(git log:*)`, `Bash(git status:*)`, `Read`.
    *   **Implementation:** The `.claude/commands/hi.md` file was updated with the corrected syntax and metadata.
    *   Committed the updated `/hi` command.
*   **Dev-Log Committing Issue & Git Workflow Refinement:**
    *   **Problem:** User was struggling to manually commit `claude-dev-log-diary` files due to pre-commit hooks failing (Tower GUI client couldn't find `pre-commit` if venv wasn't active in its context).
    *   **Previous Fix (day-005):** `pre-commit` was installed globally via Homebrew to allow Tower to find it, and `claude-dev-log-diary/` was excluded from pre-commit checks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. This fix was confirmed to be working.
    *   **New User Concern:** Preventing Claude Code itself from *accidentally* committing dev-log files when they are untracked, especially if `git add .` is used.
    *   **Discussion on Strategy:**
        *   Claude initially proposed detailed pre-commit workflow steps (`git status`, `git diff --staged`).
        *   User pushed back, emphasizing token efficiency and minimalism: `git diff --staged` is token-expensive.
        *   **Solution:** The most token-efficient and direct solution was to add a simple, explicit rule to `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
    *   **`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` Updates:**
        *   **Dev-Log Access Policy Consolidation:** The existing `dev_logs_policy` (which was a separate section) was merged into the `file_operations` (CLAUDE.md) / `File Management` (AGENTS.md) sections for conciseness. The rule became: "Never access `claude-dev-log-diary/` directory without first asking for explicit user permission. This directory contains complete console transcripts (hundreds of KBs) for historical analysis."
        *   **Instruction Synchronization:** The note about keeping `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` synchronized was moved from its own section to `project_maintenance` (CLAUDE.md) and "Additional Instructions" (AGENTS.md).
        *   **Git Staging Safety Rule:** The crucial rule was added to the `git_workflow` (CLAUDE.md) / `Commit & PR Guidelines` (AGENTS.md) sections: "Never use `git add .` - always stage files explicitly by name to avoid accidentally committing large or sensitive files."
    *   Committed these documentation updates.
*   **Claude Code Permissions Clarification:**
    *   User asked how to grant persistent tool permissions.
    *   Claude explained the use of `~/.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, and particularly `.claude/settings.local.json` (which is gitignored and auto-saves permissions granted during a session).
    *   User realized this persistence was a recent change, as previously permissions were per-session.
*   **Session Conclusion:** The session focused entirely on improving the development process and instructions for AI agents, rather than on BookMinder's core features. Key guidelines were refined for clarity, token efficiency, and safety regarding dev-logs.

**Overall:** This was a meta-session, dedicated to fine-tuning the instructions and automated helpers (`/hi` command) for Claude Code itself. The user's deep understanding of the desired workflow and their push for token-efficient, minimal, yet effective guidelines were prominent. The session ended with a much clearer and safer set of operational rules for AI-assisted development within this project.

## BookMinder - day-009.md Log Summary

This session aimed to continue development on the "List Recently Read Books via CLI" feature for BookMinder, focusing on implementing proper Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) for error handling, and further refining the project's tooling and documentation.

*   **Goal:** Implement the "List Recently Read Books via CLI" feature, specifically addressing error handling for missing/corrupt databases using ATDD, and continue refining project setup and documentation.
*   **Initial Orientation (`/hi` command):**
    *   The session started with the user invoking the custom `/hi` command.
    *   Claude Code reviewed `docs/apple_books.md` and `TODO.md`.
    *   The `/hi` command's bash execution part initially failed because Claude didn't automatically activate the virtual environment (a recurring theme). After manual activation, `pytest --spec` showed 4 tests passing.
*   **Slash Command Debugging (Continued from day-008):**
    *   User pointed out Claude's manual `find` commands were redundant if `/hi` (with its `tree` command) had worked correctly.
    *   Claude diagnosed that the `!command` syntax in the custom `/hi.md` was missing backticks (i.e., should be `!command`) for bash execution, as per Claude Code documentation.
    *   The `/hi.md` command was updated to:
        *   Use correct `!command` syntax.
        *   Include `allowed-tools: Bash(tree:*), Bash(pytest:*), Bash(git log:*), Bash(git status:*), Read`.
        *   Show the command text before its execution for clarity (e.g., `tree ...` then `!tree ...`).
        *   Use `tree -h -I '__pycache__|claude-dev-log-diary' .` to exclude the dev-log directory contents from the tree output.
    *   These changes to `/hi.md` and the `docs/apple_books.md` (from a previous session's exploration) were committed.
*   **TDD/ATDD Process for "List Recent Books" & Error Handling:**
    *   **Recap:** The project had a `list_recent_books()` function in `library.py` that was reading from the actual Apple Books SQLite database (BKLibrary), and a CLI command `bookminder list recent` that used this function. This "happy path" was working.
    *   **User Goal (ATDD):** Address error handling scenarios (missing DB, corrupt DB, no books in progress) defined in `TODO.md` using proper ATDD.
    *   **Opus's Plan Review:** The user switched to Opus model to review Sonnet's previous plan for implementing database access. Opus highlighted that Sonnet's plan was too bottom-up and complex, and suggested a simpler "Walking Skeleton" / "End-to-End First" approach:
        1.  Make the acceptance test pass with real data.
        2.  Handle missing database gracefully.
        3.  Implement a simple test strategy (mocking DB query for unit tests).
    *   **Sonnet's Execution of Opus's Plan (with user guidance):**
        1.  **Test for Real DB Access:** A unit test `it_attempts_to_read_from_bklibrary_database` was added to `library_spec.py` to ensure `list_recent_books` wasn't returning hardcoded data. This was a bit of a meta-test, and its value was later questioned.
        2.  **Real DB Implementation:** `library.py`'s `list_recent_books` was implemented to query `BKLibrary-*.sqlite` for books with `ZREADINGPROGRESS > 0`, sort by `ZLASTOPENDATE`, and convert Apple timestamps. The CLI then used this. This made the main acceptance test (`it_shows_recently_read_books_with_progress` in `cli_spec.py`) and the new unit test pass.
        3.  **Refactoring `library.py` (Opus's suggestion):** The user switched back to Opus, who pointed out that the error handling in `list_recent_books` was minimal (just returning `[]` silently). Opus suggested refactoring to extract helper functions for timestamp conversion, row-to-book mapping, and DB discovery.
        4.  **Sonnet's Refactoring:** Sonnet implemented these refactorings, making `apple_timestamp_to_datetime` a public function and creating `_row_to_book` and `_find_bklibrary_database`.
        5.  **Correcting TDD Violations (User-led):**
            *   Pavol pointed out that the `_apple_timestamp_to_datetime(None)` case was untested defensive programming, as real DB checks showed `ZLASTOPENDATE` is never NULL when `ZREADINGPROGRESS > 0`. The `None` handling was removed, making the function private again (`_apple_timestamp_to_datetime`).
            *   **Monkeypatching Issue:** A discussion arose about why monkeypatching `BKLIBRARY_DB_FILE` wasn't working as expected for CLI subprocess tests (because the glob for the DB file runs at module import time).
            *   **Solution:** Opus suggested (and Sonnet implemented) defining `BKLIBRARY_PATH` and `BKLIBRARY_DB_FILE` as module-level constants (with `BKLIBRARY_DB_FILE` being populated by a glob at import time), mirroring the `BOOKS_PLIST` pattern. This allowed simpler monkeypatching for tests.
        6.  **Testing Error Paths (for 100% coverage):**
            *   Unit tests were added to `library_spec.py` to cover the (now removed) defensive error handling: `it_returns_empty_list_when_database_not_found` (by monkeypatching `BKLIBRARY_DB_FILE` to `None`) and `it_returns_empty_list_on_database_error` (by monkeypatching `BKLIBRARY_DB_FILE` to `/dev/null`). These tests passed because the code *already had* these error returns.
        7.  **Opus's Critique (TDD Process Violation):** The user switched to Opus, who correctly pointed out that retroactively adding tests for existing (defensive) error handling code is "Coverage-Driven Development," not TDD. The error handling should have been driven by acceptance tests defining the desired user experience.
        8.  **ATDD for Error Handling (Restart):**
            *   The user agreed. The `TODO.md` was updated with Gherkin scenarios for missing/corrupt DB and no books in progress, emphasizing user-facing messages.
            *   The "smelly" unit test `it_attempts_to_read_from_bklibrary_database` was removed from `library_spec.py` after Opus confirmed it was testing implementation details, not behavior, and was a historical artifact of a flawed TDD process.
            *   The plan was to now implement the error handling scenarios from `TODO.md` using proper ATDD, starting with a failing acceptance test for the "missing database" case.
            *   A new acceptance test `it_shows_helpful_message_when_apple_books_database_not_found` was added to `cli_spec.py`. It failed initially due to the monkeypatching issue with subprocesses.
            *   Opus suggested an environment variable approach or direct CLI function testing for this.
*   **Final User Request (before credits ran out / session ended):** The user, prompted by Opus, wanted Sonnet to **remove the defensive code** from `library.py` that wasn't called for by the *original* acceptance test (the happy path for `list recent`). This was to establish proper ATDD hygiene *before* tackling the new error handling acceptance tests.
*   **The "Lost" Part of the Session:** The very end of the transcript indicates the user's frustration with losing conversation history due to using Claude Code within Cursor's terminal with limited scrollback, and an accidental `/clear` command. The user was trying to define a custom `/hi` command.
*   **Distribution Discussion:** A brief discussion on how to distribute modern Python apps, leading to the creation of `docs/modern_python_distribution.md`.

**Overall:** This was an intensive session focused on correcting past TDD process errors and establishing a more rigorous ATDD approach for new features, particularly error handling. The dialogue between Sonnet, Opus, and the user was crucial in identifying and understanding subtle but important TDD/ATDD violations. The project moved towards a cleaner state by removing untested defensive code and is poised to implement error handling correctly. The slash command debugging also highlighted some nuances of that feature. The session ended abruptly due to external factors (credit issues, lost history) right as Sonnet was about to start the ATDD cycle for error handling.
