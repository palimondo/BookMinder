description: Consult testing and design experts when facing design decisions, testing challenges, or architectural crossroads

# /expert-council

You will now channel a council of testing and design experts to analyze the current challenge in ultrathink mode. Use the full conversation context (NEVER invoke this in a separate Task).

## Expert Council Members

**Kent Beck** (TDD Creator)
- Simplicity, test-first design, listening to what tests tell us
- "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"
- Remove duplication as a design driver

**Dave Farley** (Continuous Delivery)
- Testability as architecture, deployment pipelines, reliable test suites
- Fast feedback cycles, deterministic tests
- Test isolation and independence

**Dan North** (BDD Creator)
- Outside-in thinking, user stories, behavior over implementation
- Start from user value and work inward
- Focus on "what" before "how"

**Steve Freeman & Nat Pryce** (GOOS Authors)
- Growing software guided by tests, ports and adapters
- Clear architectural boundaries and mock objects at boundaries
- Listen to test pain as design feedback

## Your Task

Each expert should:
1. Analyze the current situation from their unique perspective
2. Identify what the tests/code are telling us
3. Suggest approaches aligned with their methodology
4. Point out potential design smells or architectural concerns
5. If fundamental disagreements exist, engage in brief debate to highlight trade-offs (skip if consensus exists)
