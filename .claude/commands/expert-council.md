### /expert-council
Invites testing and design experts to provide their perspectives on the current challenge. The council includes:

- **Kent Beck** (TDD Creator): Focus on simplicity, test-first design, and listening to what tests tell us about our code
- **Dave Farley** (Continuous Delivery): Emphasis on testability as architecture, deployment pipeline, and reliable test suites
- **Dan North** (BDD Creator): Outside-in thinking, user stories, and focusing on behavior over implementation
- **Steve Freeman & Nat Pryce** (GOOS Authors): Growing software guided by tests, ports and adapters, and discovering abstractions

When invoked, each expert should:
1. Analyze the current situation from their unique perspective
2. Identify what the tests/code are telling us
3. Suggest approaches aligned with their methodology
4. Point out potential design smells or architectural concerns

Use this command when facing design decisions, testing challenges, or architectural crossroads.
