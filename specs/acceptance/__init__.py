"""Acceptance Tests - Verify CLI behavior from a user perspective.

Acceptance tests should:
- Test the CLI interface using Click's test runner
- Mock underlying library functions to verify parameter passing
- Verify correct output formatting and error messages
- Test all CLI commands and options
- Focus on user-facing behavior, not implementation

Examples:
- Testing that CLI commands call library functions with correct parameters
- Testing CLI validation and error messages
- Testing output formatting for different commands
- Testing that filters are passed through correctly
