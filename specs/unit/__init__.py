"""Unit Tests - Pure logic tests with no external dependencies.

Unit tests should:
- Test functions and classes in isolation
- Have no filesystem, database, or network dependencies
- Use mocks/stubs for any external dependencies
- Run extremely fast (milliseconds)
- Focus on testing business logic and algorithms

Examples:
- Testing pure functions that transform data
- Testing class methods with mocked dependencies
- Testing validation logic
- Testing data structures and their operations
