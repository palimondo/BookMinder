"""End-to-End Tests - Full system tests using subprocess to test the app.

E2E tests should:
- Test the complete application flow from CLI to output
- Use subprocess to execute the actual CLI commands
- Test with real fixtures and system environment
- Verify the full stack integration including all layers
- Test actual executable behavior, not just library functions

Examples:
- Testing CLI commands via subprocess with real fixture data
- Testing complete user workflows from command line to output
- Testing system-level error handling and edge cases
- Testing actual executable with real file system interactions
