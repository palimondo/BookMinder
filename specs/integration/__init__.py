"""Integration Tests - Tests that verify interactions with real external dependencies.

Integration tests should:
- Test interactions with actual external systems (filesystem, databases)
- Use real test fixtures and test data
- Verify that components work correctly together
- Test edge cases with real resources (missing files, corrupted data)
- May take longer to run than unit tests

Examples:
- Testing database queries with real SQLite files
- Testing filesystem operations with fixture files
- Testing Apple Books container structure with real fixtures
- Testing error handling with corrupted/missing resources
