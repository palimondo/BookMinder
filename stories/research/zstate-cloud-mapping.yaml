research_story:
  goal: To definitively map `ZSTATE` values in `BKLibrary.sqlite` to the "Cloud" status of books in Apple Books UI.
  hypothesis: Specific `ZSTATE` integer values correspond to books that are in iCloud but not downloaded locally.

research_steps:
  - step: Identify books in Apple Books UI that are clearly in iCloud but not downloaded (showing a cloud icon).
  - step: Query `BKLibrary.sqlite` for these specific books and record their `ZSTATE` values.
  - step: Identify books that are downloaded locally and record their `ZSTATE` values.
  - step: Compare `ZSTATE` values to infer their meaning (e.g., `ZSTATE = 5` might mean cloud-only, `ZSTATE = 1` might mean downloaded).

acceptance_criteria:
  - criteria: A clear mapping of `ZSTATE` values to "Cloud" status (e.g., `ZSTATE = 5` means cloud-only).
  - criteria: Updated documentation in `docs/apple_books.md` with this mapping.
