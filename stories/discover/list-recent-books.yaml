story:
  as_a: reader using Apple Books
  i_want: to see my recently opened books matching Apple's Continue section
  so_that: I can quickly check what I'm actively reading or exploring

acceptance_criteria:
  - scenario: Show recently opened books including samples
    when: I run "bookminder list recent"
    then:
      - I see up to 10 books matching Apple's Continue section
      - Includes books with reading progress (1-99%)
      - Includes recently opened samples
      - Each book shows: Title, Author, Progress % or "Sample"
      - Books are ordered by last opened date (newest first)
      - Excludes finished books (marked as complete)
      - Applies recency cutoff (~7 days)

notes:
  - Replicates Apple Books Continue section for consistency with UI
  - Important for MCP integration - agents see what users see in the app
  - Samples show "Sample" label instead of progress percentage
  - Cloud samples should show cloud indicator alongside Sample label
