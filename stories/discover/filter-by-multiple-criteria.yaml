story:
  as_a: reader using Apple Books
  i_want: to combine multiple filters
  so_that: I can narrow down my book list to exactly what I'm looking for

acceptance_criteria:
  - scenario: Combine cloud and sample filters
    when: I run "bookminder list --filter cloud --filter sample"
    then:
      - I see only sample books stored in iCloud (ZSTATE = 6)
      - Multiple filters use AND logic

  - scenario: Combine exclusion filters
    when: I run "bookminder list --filter !cloud --filter !sample"
    then:
      - I see only full books downloaded locally
      - Excludes both cloud books and samples

  - scenario: Mix inclusion and exclusion filters
    when: I run "bookminder list --filter in-progress --filter !sample"
    then:
      - I see only books I'm currently reading that are not samples
      - Shows books with 1-99% progress excluding samples
