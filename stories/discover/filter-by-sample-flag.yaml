story:
  as_a: reader using Apple Books
  i_want: to filter my book list by sample status
  so_that: I can easily find or exclude sample books
status: backlog

acceptance_criteria:
  - scenario: Show only samples
    when: I run "bookminder list [any] --filter sample"
    then:
      - I see only books marked as samples
      - Sample books show "Sample" instead of progress percentage
      - Results respect the base command's scope (all books vs recent books)

  - scenario: Exclude samples
    when: I run "bookminder list [any] --filter !sample"
    then:
      - I see only regular books (not samples)
      - Books show their actual reading progress if applicable
      - Results respect the base command's scope

notes:
  - Sample filter applies consistently to any list command
  - Filters narrow down the results of the base command
  - "[any] represents: all, recent, or future list commands"
