story:
  as_a: reader using Apple Books
  i_want: to filter my book list by reading status
  so_that: I can quickly find books based on my reading habits

acceptance_criteria:
  - scenario: List finished books
    when: I run "bookminder list --status finished"
    then:
      - I see only books marked as complete
      - Each book shows: Title, Author, (Finished) status
      - (Finished) status takes precedence over progress percentage

  - scenario: List unread books
    when: I run "bookminder list --status unread"
    then:
      - I see only books with 0% reading progress and not marked as finished
      - Each book shows: Title, Author, (Unread) status

  - scenario: List books in progress
    when: I run "bookminder list --status in-progress"
    then:
      - I see only books with 1-99% reading progress and not marked as finished
      - Each book shows: Title, Author, Progress %
